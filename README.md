brackets-ide
================
This extension provides Brackets with integrated development capabilities like compiling, error line markers, and debugging support. Current status: works only with PHP for now.

It is possible to create own build systems via 'Edit>Edit Builder' menu item and editing opened JSON-file (you need to restart Brackets). 

Use the left Run icon or press Ctrl(Cmd)-Alt-B to build current file.
