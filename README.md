Integrated Development for Brackets
================
This extension provides Brackets with integrated development capabilities like compiling, error line markers, and debugging support. Currently works with PHP, Python, JavaScript(Node), and Ruby!

Use the left Run icon or press Ctrl(Cmd)-Alt-B to build current file.

Notes:

1. **You must have the compiler/interpreter installed within your global path for this extension to execute it.**
2. It is possible to create own build systems via 'Edit>Edit Builder' menu item and editing opened JSON-file (you need to restart Brackets). 
3. The build action will save all working set files of the same filetype automatically.

TODO:

* Polish the Run Results panel
* Support charactor line locations for error ranges
* Add Java support
* Add step-by-step debugging support

**Pull Requests are encouraged and will be quickly reviewed for merging!**
