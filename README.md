Integrated Development for Brackets
================
This extension provides Brackets with integrated development capabilities like compiling, error line markers, and debugging support. Currently works with PHP, Python, JavaScript(Node), and Ruby!

Use the left Run icon or press Ctrl(Cmd)-Alt-B to build current file.

Notes:
1. **You must have the compiler/interpreter installed within your global path for this extension to execute it.**
2. It is possible to create own build systems via 'Edit>Edit Builder' menu item and editing opened JSON-file (you need to restart Brackets).
